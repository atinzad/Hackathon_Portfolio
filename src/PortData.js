In anticipation of the winter solstice, Anne Hardy has taken inspiration from the rhythms of the earth and the tides of the River Thames. From 30 November 2019 to 26 January 2020, the building’s grand entrance is turned into a marooned temple, appearing with tattered banners and tangled lights, while sculptural objects cascade down the steps from the shuttered central door, surrounded by an atmospheric soundscape of rain, thunder, birds and insects.",

    desc: "British artist Anne Hardy curates the Arts Council Collection in Towner’s eighth and final exhibition as part of the Arts Council Collection National Partners Programme 2016-19. Anne Hardy’s work derives from places she calls ‘pockets of wild space’ – gaps in the urban space where materials, atmospheres, and emotions gather – using what she finds there to manifest sensory and unstable installation works that fully immerse you. Hardy brings this approach to her selection for Towner, envisioning the gallery space as a shifting impermanent landscape, a meditative environment shaped by local weather data",

    desc: "‘Anne Hardy’s wooden structure is reminiscent of a prop from a film made long ago and already forgotten. Initially, it’s uncertain whether it’s an object or a piece of architecture. Jacked up with breeze blocks as if it is mobile and could move away, the dissolution of traditional architecture’s usual position firmly on the ground creates a mysterious transitional situation.",
